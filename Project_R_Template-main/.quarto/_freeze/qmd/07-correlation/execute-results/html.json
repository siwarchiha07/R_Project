The spectral absorption coefficient at 436nm ($\\mathrm m^{-1}$) is a measure of the\ncolor intensity of the filtered water. The data set is a subset from field measurements, \nthat contained more samples from several measurement campaigns.\n\nThe question is whether Ammonium (NH4), Oxygen (O2) and Color depend \non the organic load (COD).\n\n\n## Data analysis\n\nFor the dependency between Color and COD we can use Pearson correlation.\nIn addition it is always a good idea to plot the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(COD, Color)\ncor.test(COD, Color)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe see an almost linear dependency and get a highly significant correlation.\nNow, for the dependence between Ammonium on COD we can proceed with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(COD, NH4)\ncor.test(COD, NH4)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe find again significant correlation. However, the dependency is not very\nstrict and it seems that there are two different data sets.\nThis is in fact true because sampling sites 1--9 were before and\nthe other sampling sites below a cooling reservoir of a power plant. In the following,\nwe create first an empty `plot(...., type = \"n\")` and then add the station number\nas text labels:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(COD, NH4, type = \"n\")\ntext(COD, NH4, labels = Station)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe now repeat the analysis with the first 9 data pairs from the stations upstream \nof the cooling reservoir ([50.19N, 24.40E, Link to Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/jKwanmqjdTwY6oKv6)):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(COD[1:9], NH4[1:9])\ncor.test(COD[1:9], NH4[1:9])\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercises and discussion\n\nIs oxygen concentration (O2) directly related to organic\npollution (COD)? Interpret the results, and discuss the potential mechanisms how the\ncooling reservoir may influence water quality. Compare your conclusions with the paper of\n@Ertel2012. Does the assumption of independent residuals hold? \n\nRepeat the analysis with Spearman's correlation, and compare the results with the \nPearson correlation coefficients.\n\n\n# Example 2: Examination results in statistics\n\n## Introduction\n\nGiven is a number of students that passed an examination in statistics. The examination\nwas written two times, one time before and one time after an additional\nseries of lectures. The values represent the number of points approached\nduring the examination. Check whether there is a dependency between the results\nbefore and after the test, i.e. if there is any dependency between the results of\nthe final test and the basic knowledge before the course.\n\n## Data and data analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx1 <- c(69, 77, 35, 34, 87, 45, 95, 83)\nx2 <- c(100, 97, 67, 42, 75, 73, 92, 97)\ncor.test(x1, x2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we plot this, we see a rather strange pattern, i.e. no clear linear relationship:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(x1, x2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTherefore it may be a good idea to use the rank correlation:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor.test(x1, x2, method=\"spearman\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nSometimes, we may get a warning that it \"cannot compute exact p-values with\nties\", then we can use another approach and compute the Spearman correlation\nvia the Pearson correlation of ranks:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor.test(rank(x1), rank(x2))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis needs a little bit more effort (for the computer, not for us),\nbut the interpretation is the same. To understand how this worked, it can be a \ngood idea to create a scatterplot of the ranks of both variables.\n\n## Exercise and Discussion\n\nWhat do the results above tell us? Compare the results with a paired t-test \nof the same data set. Which test tells what? \n\n# References\n\n",
