Here we\nintroduce the following concepts:\n\n1. trend stationarity and difference stationarity\n2. autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation\n3. test for stationarity\n4. test for a monotonic trend\n\nThe general procedure should then be applied to two real data sets as an exercise. \nPlease keep in mind that the main objective here is trend analysis. The concepts of\nstationarity and autocorrelation and the related tests are only used as pre-tests to check \nif simple trend tests are possible. Please note also the importance of the \n**effect size**, e.g. the temperature increase pear year.\n\nThe book of @Kleiber2008 contains an excellent explanation of the methods \ndescribed here and is strongly recommended for further reading.\n\n# Demonstration of methods (artificial data set)\n\n## Data set\n\nThe data set \"timeseries.txt\" contains artificial data with specifically designed \nproperties, similar to the **TSP** and **DSP** series in the tutorial [https://tpetzoldt.github.io/elements/](https://tpetzoldt.github.io/elements/).\n\nThe data sets are available from [https://tpetzoldt.github.io/datasets/](https://tpetzoldt.github.io/datasets/). \nYou can either download it locally or modify the code that the data are directly \nread from the web. Then convert it to time series objects (`ts`), to make their analysis easier.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- read.csv(\"timeseries.csv\")\nTSP <- ts(dat$TSP)\nDSP <- ts(dat$DSP)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to plot the data first. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(TSP)\nplot(DSP)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation\n\nFirst, plot the autocorrelation (`acf`) and partial autocorrelation (`pacf`) of the DSP series:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nacf(DSP)\npacf(DSP)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](12-timeseries-trends_files/figure-html/acf-plot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n... and interpret the results.\n\nThen plot the `acf` for both series, together with the autocorrelation of the \ndifferenced and residual time series:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow=c(2,3))\nacf(TSP)\nacf(diff(TSP))\nacf(residuals(lm(TSP~time(TSP))))\nacf(DSP)\nacf(diff(DSP))\nacf(residuals(lm(DSP~time(DSP))))\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere, `diff` is used for differencing the time series i.e. to compute differences \nbetween consecutive values, while `lm` fits a linear regression from which `residuals`\nextracts the residuals.\n\nThe autocorrelation function `acf` can be used to identify specific patterns. \nA series is considered as approximately stationary, if all autocorrelations \n(except for $lag=0$) are \"almost non-significant\".\n\n**Hint:** Deconstruct the parenthetisized statements like `acf(residuals(lm(TSP~time(TSP))))`\ninto 3 separate lines to understand better what they do. Plot the data and the trend.\n\n\n## Stationarity test\n\nThe Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test checks directly for stationarity,\nwhere $H_0$ may be either level stationarity or trend stationarity. **Don't get confused:**\n\n* **level stationary** is just the same as **stationary**, the additional \"level\" \n  just makes it clearer.\n* in contrast, **trend stationary** is essentially non-stationary, but can \neasily be made stationary by subtracting a trend, because the **residuals** are stationary.\n* the warning message of the KPSS test is normal and not an \"error\", its just an information that\nthe true p-value is either smaller or greater than the printed value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"tseries\")\nkpss.test(TSP, null=\"Level\") # instationary\nkpss.test(TSP, null=\"Trend\") # stationary after trend removal\nkpss.test(DSP, null=\"Level\") # instationary\nkpss.test(DSP, null=\"Trend\") # still instationary\nkpss.test(diff(DSP), null=\"Level\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n<!--\nInstead of the KPSS test, also the 'adf.test' (the augmented Dickey-Fuller\ntest,a so-called unit root test) can also be used for detecting instationarity.\nInterested students may have a look in the tutorial,\nbut note the opposite formulation of $H_a$ and $H_0$!\n-->\n\n## Mann-Kendall test for trends\n\nThis is now finally the main test. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"Kendall\")\nMannKendall(TSP) # correct only for trend stationary time series\nMannKendall(DSP) # wrong, because time series was difference stationary\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Real data set: air and water temperature\n\nNow, let's try to find out if we can find linear trends in real data sets.\n\n**Scientific Hypothesis:** The air temperature in Dresden and the water temperature of Saidenbach Reservoir increased during the last decades.\n\n**Data sets:**\n\n* **mean April air temperature** from the meteorological station Klotsche near Dresden \n(source: German Weather Service, DWD http://www.dwd.de) and\n\n* **water temperature in May** in 3m depth of the Saidenbach drinking water reservoir, \n source: Ecological station 19hain, unpublished data. Many thanks to Dr. René Sachse \n and Dr. Lothar Paul for giving permission.\n\nThe data are available from [https://tpetzoldt.github.io/datasets/](https://tpetzoldt.github.io/datasets/) and then converted to a time series object. Please\nnote the `start` argument that sets the start year of that object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat1 <- read.csv(\"airtemp_april.csv\")\ndat2 <- read.csv(\"watertemp_may.csv\")\n\nTair <- ts(dat1$T, start=1967)\nTwat <- ts(dat2$May, start=1975)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Trend of air temperature\n\nThe plot seems to show an increasing trend, especially since 1980. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(Tair)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Test of stationarity**\n\nTest for stationarity for the original and the trend adjusted series graphically \nwith `acf` and quantitatively with the KPSS test:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkpss.test(Tair)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe see that $p < 0.01$ so it is not \"level stationary\"!\n\nBut if we allow for a trend:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkpss.test(Tair, null=\"Trend\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n... we get $p > 0.05$ i.e. it is trend stationary (stationary after trend removal). Therefore, a trend test is possible.\n\n**Trend test**\n\nWe use the Mann-Kendall test dirst, that tests for monotonous trends:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMannKendall(Tair)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow we fit a linear model to find out how much the temperature increased per day during this time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm <- lm(Tair ~ time(Tair))\nsummary(m)\nplot(Tair)\nabline(m, col=\"red\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow test the assumptions. Firstly test that the residuals have no autocorrelation:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacf(residuals(m))\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Optional Task:** use additional diagnostics, e.g. plot residuals versus fitted or `qqnorm(residuals(m))` to test for normal distribution. Write the results down and evaluate what they can tell us. \n\nQuestions: \n\n* Is the trend significant?\n* which of the used tests is the best to test for a trend?\n* what does \"monotonous\" mean?\n* What is the advantage of fitting a linear model?\n* What is the purpose of checking autocorrelation of the residuals with `acf`?\n\n\n## Stationarity and trend of water temperature\n\nNow repeat the same for the water temperature data, interpret the results and \nwrite a short report.  Read about limnology of stratified lakes in temperate climate zones and discuss reasons why the trend of water temperature is weaker or stronger than air temperature.\n\n**Scientific Questions**\n\n1. Was there a significant trend in water and air temperature? \n2. How much Kelvin (degrees centigrade) did the water temperature increase on average during this time?\n3. Was the trend of water weaker or stronger than for air temperature? Which lake-physical processes are responsible for this effect?\n\n# Homework project 2025\n\nFind a publicly available data set about surface water or air temperature and analyse its trend (\"own data set\"). Compare your results with the data set from Dresden and / or Saidenbach reservoir (given data sets) or a second own data set:\n\n1. Visualize the data sets.\n2. Do proper aggregation (e.g. monthly or annual mean) using **tidyverse** functions.\n3. Analyse it for trend and measure the effect size.\n4. Compare the trend graphically and numerically with the trend of the air temperature in Dresden-Klotzsche or the water temperature of Saidenbach reservoir.\n5. Find at least two publications to discuss your results in context.\n\nThe \"own data set\" can be a data set from your home country, from a prominent location in the world, or another lake or measurement station in Germany. It should cover at least 20 years of regular mesurements, ideally with a daily or monthly resolution. The comparison between the \"own data set\" and one of the \"given data sets\" should make sense, e.g. air temperature from different stations in the same month or air and water temperature from stations nearby.\n\n\n**Communication:** We expect a unique solution from every group, but teamwork and communication are allowed. Use the chat group to ask technical issues (e.g. where to get data sets or how to do data aggregation) and to share interpretation of the results.\n\n**Formatting and style:** The page limit is 3-5 pages (plus references and an optional title page), font size should be 11 or 12 points, line spacing 1.1-1.3 lines, reasonable page margins (at least 2cm). The outline should stricly follow an IMRaD (Introduction, Methods Results and Discussion) structure. Figures and tables should be numbered and have a caption. Short code can be part of the text, longer code segments and purely technical tables should be avoided. The report can be written with any text processing software (e.g. Quarto or Word).\n\n**Submission date:** 2025-01-19 to allow feedback before the examination period. \n\n<!--\n# Terms of use and data sets\n\nThis document is licensed according to the Creative Comons Attribution 4.0 \nInternational ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) license.\nThe data sets are available online from https://github.com/tpetzoldt/datasets .
