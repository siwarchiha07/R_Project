Discuss which of the\nplots best shows the shape of the **distribution** of discharge\ndata. You can include up to 4 plots. Add a compact table with the statistical\nparameters for the observational period (min, max, $\\bar{x}, s_x$, median, geometric mean and\nquartiles).\n\nThen discuss all results (parameters and figures) in connection.\n\n**Compare Distribution Models** \n\nAnalyze and discuss the different data transformations (no transformation, $\\ln(x)$, and $\\ln(x−b)$). Justify which transformation/model provides the best overall fit for the discharge data and explain why the others are less suitable.\n\n**Optional (+ 1 page):** Estimate the 100 year flood by using the right one-sided 1% prediction interval.\nChoose a proper distribution model, derived from the results before. Compare it with the empirical quantiles. \n\n\n**Optional (+ 1 page):** Extreme Value Analysis\n\nEstimate the 100-year flood by using the right one-sided 1% prediction interval.\n\n* Choose a proper distribution model, derived from the results before.\n  Compare the chosen model with the empirical quantiles.\n  See lab manual \"Distribution and Confidence Intervals of Maple Leaf Samples\" as an example.\n* Consider to use the Extended Data Set (starting from 1806) for this analysis to maximize the record length.\n\n\n# Task 2: Dry and wet years\n\nAnalyse the data and identify 2 dry and 2 wet years. Try to spot years\nwith different seasonal characteristics, e.g. one with a dry winter\nand the other with a dry summer, or one with a wet winter and a dry\nsummer and so on.\n\nDescribe the selected years with appropriate plots, e.g. time series\nfrom Section 3.2 or annual cumulative sums (Section 3.5). A boxplot,\nhistograms or own ideas are also possible (2-4 plots at maximum).\n\n# Outline and formal requirements\n\n\n## Outline\n\nCombine all tasks together and tell a story, using a standard scientific outline,\nthe so-called IMRAD scheme:\n\n1. Introduction\n2. Methods\n3. Results\n4. Discussion\n5. References\n\nPlease consult [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD) for a detailed explanation.\n\nAs it is a tiny report, Methods and Results may be merged in this case.\nHowever, Introduction and Discussion must be separated.\nUse the internet and find about 2-3 literature references for the Discussion.\n\n\n## Workflow\n\n\n1. Draft: draft your report. The first draft is usually somewhat longer.\n2. Refine: Discuss and select only the most important parts, and create the final version adhering to the page limit.\n\n**Communicate in your team, with other teams and with tutors**\n\n* Primary Goal: Communication should promote community learning. Post approaches and specific questions in the Matrix^Matrix chat group so everyone can benefit.\n* Teamwork: Discuss ideas within your team and with other colleagues first. Private channels for teamwork are allowed.\n* In the chatroom, please formulate specific questions (e.g., \"How to format the numbers on a log-transformed axis?\") and avoid asking only, \"Is this correct?\"\n* Contribute: Actively contribute to answering your classmates' questions!\n\n## Report formatting instructions\n\nTo ensure clarity and efficiency, please adhere to the following strict page limits and formatting guidelines.\n\n### Page limits and content focus\n\n* Core Content Limit: The main body of the report (Introduction, Methods & Results, Discussion) must not exceed 4 A4 pages.\n* This limit forces you to distill the essential messages and choose only the most important figures.\n* The Title Page (Cover Sheet) and the List of References do not count towards the 4-page limit.\n* Quality First: The goal is Quality instead of quantity! Use the limited space to focus on the interpretation and discussion of your findings.\n\n### Text and visual balance\n\n* The report must have a good balance between explanatory text and supporting figures/tables.\n* Avoid reports that are dominated by either large amounts of text or excessive, unexplained graphics.\n* Selectivity: Only include figures and statistical output that are essential to support your claims in the text. Avoid \"dumping\" unnecessary output.\n\n### Readability and citation standards\n\n* Use a font size of 11 or 12 points.\n* A line spacing of 1.2 lines is recommended to improve readability.\n* Figures: **font size** of annotations must be well readable.\n* Citation: Cite literature properly using the author-year style. Good examples can be found at the [APA style web page](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples).\n\n## Submission\n\nYou will have 2.5 weeks time for the preparation of the report. Then upload it as  PDF or HTML document and (optionally) your .R or Quarto (.qmd) scripts to the **File** folder of your group in the OPAL learning management system. \nSubmissions after the deadline cannot be considered.\n\n[^OPAL]: [OPAL](https://tud.de/opal)  is the learning managament platform used by TU Dresden.\n[^Matrix]: TU Dresden uses the [Matrix](https://doc.matrix.tu-dresden.de) instant messenger.\n",
